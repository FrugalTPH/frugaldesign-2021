The assembled facets had to fit a pre-bought geodesic climbing frame, so a client-measured survey was done remotely under our guidance. The client was able to build it successfully first time without the need for rework."

## BACKGROUND

Visual Feeder lights up the city streets with full-motion advertising on high traffic commercial retail locations. The company has exclusive locations in flagship stores, shopping malls, and high traffic retail locations, creating an immersive experience that is highly targeted to its audience.

The client commissioned Frugal to develop a series of CNC flat patterns to fit a steel geodesic frame that the company had previously purchased. The sheet patterns would be folded together to form a complex 3D geodome screen supported by the frame, which would be used for an upcoming visual projection mapping project.

## PROJECT CHALLENGE

The geodome is a 3D space frame, with very few of its members being aligned with the main orthographic planes.

There were 11 different member types, made of steel pipe with pressed ends which incorporate holes for bolted node connections. The pressed ends have slight angles on them, making accurate estimation of the position of each member quite challenging.

The entire project was to be delivered remotely using MS Teams for project communication. There were also no technical drawings or detailed measurements of the geodome which the client had purchased, and no opportunity to physically survey the frame ourselves.

We would have to pre-model the frame to determine the key dimensions and then direct the client to take those physical measurements remotely, at their workshop in Chicago.

Part of the initial challenge involved modelling & rationalising the internal facades/surfaces, to minimise the number of unique folded sheet patterns that would be needed. Following that, another challenge would be allowing appropriate tolerances for measurement error & assembly variations, as well as leaving an adequate gap back to the frame.

Though mostly a 3D modelling contract, a small amount of design work was also carried out to arrive at a robust & workable folded sheet pattern and have confidence that it would go together without any major issues or scrap/wastage.

## WHAT WE DID

Frugal started by producing a parametric 3D “stick” model representation of the geodesic frame based on its nominal diameter & height. This informed understanding as to which dimensions would be key. Only a handful of survey measurements were needed in the end.

We then adjusted the stick model to match the client survey data and proceeded to model the internal façade as a single-skinned surface model. Each unique facet was used as the reference shape to design a corresponding sheet pattern.

Edge flanges were added to the sheets to make the edge connections. Punched holes were added for cable-tie mounts. And identifying  features were added to each edge to allow easy identification & correct location during assembly.

We assembled the sheets into an assembly model to virtually test the build, before going on to generate the CNC flat pattern files, as well as assembly instructions and several illustrations & renders.

## PROJECT OUTCOME

Frugal delivered the 2D flat patterns in Adobe Illustrator and SVG file format, which the client opted to cut out manually due to lead-time constraints. 

After cutting out all the panels the client assembled them in their workshop following the assembly illustrations & guidance that we’d provided.

The additional outputs we provided in the course of works - such as illustrations & renders - also proved to have been useful to the client for project communications, planning & marketing. 

The client was able to assemble the panels correctly the first time without any modifications being required, feeding back to us that:

> The measurements ended up working great! 
> 
> Tom went above and beyond. Very experienced, professional, and timely. Cares about his work and my overall project. His deliverables were very professional & provided clear additional information. Perfect on everything 10/10! Will definitely be working with him again!

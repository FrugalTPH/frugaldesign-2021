Alt_Title: "Case Study: Complex Structure Concept Design"
Alt_Description: "This case study recounts work we undertook to design a fabricated structural frame to support a reinforced concrete sculpture. The sculpture was a female form from the torso up, having complex geometry and limited internal space. We worked to develop an efficient frame that was easy to build and that sat as close as possible to the internal walls of the sculpture, thus minimising the weight of plate-work needed to take up the gaps."

## BACKGROUND

Daniel Popper is a multidisciplinary artist known globally for his larger-than-life sculptures, and spectacular public art installations. From Cape Town, South Africa, Daniel has travelled the globe creating an array of sculptures, installations, and stages. Daniel specialises in interactive art, public art, stage design, installation art, and interior design.

Daniel commissioned Frugal to redesign & optimise the internal fabricated support frame for one of his sculptures that was intended to be a feature piece for an 11th-floor pool deck in a new leisure facility.

## PROJECT CHALLENGE

A complex 3D surface model defined the sculptural skin, which was to be manufactured as a multi-segmented 60mm thick steel-reinforced concrete shell. The sculpture was to be manufactured in the far east and shipped in a single ISO shipping container – substantially complete – to the site.

A particular challenge was determining the “inner skin” surface, which would constrain the topology of the support structure. The original surface model needed a lot of cleaning up before a defeatured offset surface could be generated (which is a challenging operation in itself).

The support frame was needed to adequately resist the significant weight of the concrete shell, as well as 120MPH winds from any direction. Also, the sculpture needed to ship in two parts and therefore have a substantial bolted connection at the neck joint.

Manufacturing & assembly would also pose significant challenges, whereby internal access would be required for fitting the shell sections to the frames in the factory, and then on-site there should be minimal work to do other than lifting the two parts into position & torquing the bolts.

In the client concept, a series of thin steel web-plates bridged between the support frame and the concrete shell, taking up variation and providing opportunity/mitigation to adjust the bespoke structure to “make it fit” during factory assembly. In this respect getting the support frame as close as possible to the concrete skin – hence minimising the area of web-plates required – was seen as beneficial. This was another significant challenge given the complexity of the shell.

Finally the development of these complex frames – as a process in itself – had been slow, costly & error-prone due to the bespoke nature of each sculpture (each one is different!). As such, Daniel was keen for Frugal to bear this in mind and develop a streamlined workflow to improve the development process for these sculptures in future.

## WHAT WE DID

Working from the artist's mesh model & various other inputs we:

* Produced a BREP solid 3D model of the concrete shell, as a reference for the fabrication design.
* Generated load cases & combinations and carried out the structural design.
* Assessed transport & other requirements to determine the best approach for the bolted connections.
* Generated several different frame designs to assess & converge upon a good solution.
* Generated several different lifting schemes & connection designs to find a good solution.
* Produced 3D geometry models using Solidworks.
* Produced analysis models using STAAD Pro.
* Carried out embodiment design calculations to demonstrate confidence in the structural design.
* Maintained a model structure (BOM) throughout.
* Produced an overall general arrangement drawing including base reactions for the site engineer.
* Produced sub-frame arrangement drawings for use in manufacturing planning & cost estimates.
* Provided consultation & advice to the client’s engineer on the processes I had used throughout.

## PROJECT OUTCOME

Frugal took a new & different approach to develop the support frames for this type of bespoke sculpture (which differ in size and geometry every time). The workflow we developed can be used on future projects, and we are optimistic that it will deliver many benefits, including:

* Improving the ease & pace of manufacture & assembly.
* Improving quality (particularly structural strength & robustness).
* Reducing materials & labour costs.

Daniel and his local engineering designer were very happy with the workflow, the designs that it produced, and the quality and value in the deliverables. They intend to manufacture the sculpture in due course and are keen to commission Frugal to work on a few other projects that are in the pipeline.

## BACKGROUND

Thorworld Industries is a material handling fabricator based in Chesterfield. The business was founded in 1986 and aims to provide the logistics industry with the best solutions to their loading and unloading problems. They offer an extensive range of quality off-the-shelf products at competitive prices, as well as being able to adapt their range and provide bespoke solutions to suit individual customer requirements. 

One of their key product ranges – mobile yard ramps – allows forklift trucks to safely and rapidly traverse height differences in loading areas (most typically into and out of shipping containers and warehouse loading bays/docks).

## PROJECT CHALLENGE

Between 2002 and 2005 steel prices had more than doubled, and those increases were showing no sign of slowing, let alone falling back down. At the same time cheap imports – often of questionable quality – were beginning to seep into the market and steal market share. These and other pressures had resulted in a gradual erosion of margin on fabricated products, which was a major threat to the ongoing sustainability of the business. 

Thorworld were keen to support British manufacturing by keeping ramp production in the UK, so decided to implement a strategy of product design optimisation. Tom was challenged to redesign Thorworld’s biggest selling (type 6 and 7) mobile yard ramps in 2005, and then to develop entirely new yard ramp designs between 2007 to 2009 (ultimately yielding types 8, 9 and 10).

## WHAT WE DID

Tom lead the product range's design development programme, which covered activities  such as:

* Carrying out product research and compiling a new set of product design specifications for review, debate and agreement. 
* Setting up initial baseline models of each ramp and carried out various quantitative and undertaking qualitative analyses to find out how the existing designs performed, and to identify opportunities for improvement. 
* Collating project stakeholders' ideas and coming up with many of his own, and then developing and communicating numerous fully costed design options using 3D CAD. 
* Testing and demonstrating confidence in his designs using 3D CAE and hand calculations against BS standards.
* Liaising very closely with buyers, shop-floor welders and machine operators throughout to ensure the designs were buildable. 
* Planning and overseeing physical type testing.
* Collating comprehensive technical files for CE marking purposes.

## PROJECT OUTCOME

As a result of the product development work undertaken, Thorworld were able to:

* Offer its customers a wider variety of ramp variants and capacities.
* Reduce its prices whilst simultaneously raising its margin back to sustainable levels.
* Produce more ramps, more quickly, due to design for manufacture and assembly improvements.

The following chart shows the extent and success of the yard ramp development work led by Tom:

 ![Figure 5: New ramp types 8, 9 and 10 were completely new designs developed between 2007 and 2009, and were up to 40% lighter than the 2004 models of equivalent capacity & function.](%assets_url%/blog/yard-ramps-fig5.webp)

As a direct result of this work, Thorworld were able to weather the storm of the financial crisis whilst competitors fared less well, and they are now the leading container ramp company in the UK and Ireland.
